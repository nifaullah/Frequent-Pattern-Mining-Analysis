# Frequent-Pattern-Mining-Analysis-Academic-Hands-On
Academic Project - Frequent Pattern Mining Analysis 

Data: Multiple datasets, all added to the repository.

Language: Python 3

Goal: This was a project designed by the professor to test our understanding and application of Frequent Pattern Mining module learned in the class. This module included topics such as frequent pattern mining algorithms such as Naive, Apriori, Eclat and FP Growth and ideas frequent itemsets, minimum support, Maximal itemsets, Closed Itemset, Subsequence mining and Substring mining.

Approach: Professor provides us with dataset and then asks students to implement certain operations and then asks us explain the results of those operations. A sample practise module is also provided to familiarize with test.

Citation/Acknowledgement: This analysis was done as a part of requirement for CS 6052 - Intelligent Data Analysis course instructed by Dr. Gowtham Atluri at the University of Cincinnati. Most of the sample codes are used from the practise module.

Note: As you see there's no ipynb file provided, this is due to the project was done using the OSC's cloud (https://www.osc.edu/resources/online_portals/ondemand) and a PDF was downloaded from their to submit as final work. An attempt is being made to retrieve the file, it'd uploaded here once retrieved

Score: 9.5/10
